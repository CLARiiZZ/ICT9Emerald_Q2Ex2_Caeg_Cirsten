In the timeline where the novel started, he's described as a cold, stubborn, and cruel character, one that even Kim Dokja wouldn't want to meet despite being a loyal reader of his novel. Although, he was originally a caring person at heart, but the continuous regressions of his cruel life wore him down and turned him into the way he is now.</p>
